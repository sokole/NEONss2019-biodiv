Download data

if (file.exists(beetle_dir)){
  load(beetle_dir)

Grab necessary columns from different tables. Important column info:
* sampleID: unique ID for each combination of domainID, siteID, plotID, trapID, and collectDate (unique ID for bet_fielddata table)
* subsampleID: unique ID for each group of individuals, multiple per sample (unique ID for bet_sorting); unclear why there are muliple entries for the same classification
* individualID: unique ID for each individual identified by taxonomists (unique ID for bet_parataxonimist table)

There are multiple levels of taxonomic identification, need to decide which level of rigor we care about (NEON id often just to family, taxonomist ID to species but only for a subset, DNA ID for even smaller subset).

This first chunk also adds a new `trappingDays` column to account for effort. For each unique siteID/plotID/trapID/eventID combination (so each sample event for each trap) the number of days the trap was set before sampling is calculated.

There should be one boutID for each collectDate at each site. eventID doesn't quite do the trick since it can be associated with multiple sample days (usually consecutive) and there can be more than one eventID for a collectDate within a site (some plots have different eventID). So we create a new boutID that identifies a sampling period on a site.

  ux <- unique(x)
  ux[which.max(tabulate(match(x, ux)))]

  mutate(trappingDays = interval(ymd(setDate), ymd(collectDate)) %/% days(1))

Join taxonomic data from pinning with the sorting data

Join expert data to existing pinning and sorting data

# Replacement old taxon info with expert info, where available
# NOTE - This is repetitive with the code snippet above, and if you want to do it this way you can just combine the calls into one chunk. BUT, you may
#     want to do more than this, as it is *just* a replacement of IDs for individual beetles that an expert identified. If the expert identified
#           a sample as COLSP6 instead of CARSP14, though, then all CARSP14 from that trap on that date should probably be updated to COLSP6â€¦
